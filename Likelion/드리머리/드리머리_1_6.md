# ~~URL Include~~  
- ~~App 별로 URL을 관리할 수 있도록 **구조화**함~~  
- [22]는 구조화(x) [23]이 구조화(O)  
- ### ~~사용~~  
~~1. App~~  
>> ~~폴더 내에 `urls.py` 생성~~  
>> ~~```~~  
>> ~~from django.urls import path~~  
>> ~~from . Import views~~  
>>
>> ~~Urlpatterns = [~]~~  
>>  ~~```~~

# ~~Template 상속~~  
- ~~중복 제거~~  
- base.html 이용 : project폴더 내 OK / app폴더 내 OK (Django덕)  
- ~~다른 페이지 내용이 들어올 부분은 {% block %} {% endblock %} 이용~~  
- ~~다른 페이지에서는 Extends로 불러옴~~  
- ### ~~사용~~  
~~1. Base.html~~  
~~```~~  
>> ~~<!doctype html>~~  
>> ~~<head>~~  
>>   ~~<link href={% block link %}~~  
>>          ~~ ~ ~~  
>>   ~~{% endblock %}~~  
>> ~~</head>~~  
>> ~~<body>~~  
>>    ~~ ~ ~~  

>> ~~{% block content %}~~  
>>     ~~ ~ ~~  
>>    ~~{% endblock %}~~  
>>     ~~~~~  
>> ~~</body>~~  
        ~~```~~  
~~2. Home.html~~  
>> ~~```~~  
>> ~~{% extends 'base.html' %}~~  
>>
>> ~~{% block link %}~~  
>> ~~{% static 'css/home.css' %}~~  
>> ~~{% endblock %}~~  
>> 
>> ~~{% block content %}~~  
>> ~~ ~ ~~ 
>> ~~{% endblock %}~~ 
>>  ~~```~~

# 실습  

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% block link %} {% endblock %}">
> base.css 뒤에 적기   
> CSS적용 순서때문 (↓)
