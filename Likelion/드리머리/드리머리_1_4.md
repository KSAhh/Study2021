# ~~Model~~  
- ~~데이터에 접속하고 관리하도록 도와주는 객체~~  
- ~~class VS object~~  

### ~~생성과 적용~~  
~~1. models.py~~  
>> ~~모델명의 첫 글자는 무조건 대문자~~  
>> ~~```~~  
>> ~~class Designer(models.Model):~~  
>>    ~~image = models.ImageField(upload_to = 'images/'~~  
>>    ~~name = models.CharField(max_length = 50)~~  
>>    ~~address = models.CharField(max_length = 255)~~  
>>    ~~description = models.TextField()~~  
>>      ~~```~~  
2. ~~Terminal~~  
>>          ~~```~~
>> # ~~DB가 알아듣도록 번역하기~~  
>> ~~python manage.py makemigrations (+ App 이름)~~  
>>              ~~```~~  

>>                      ~~```~~  
>> # ~~번역한 내용 DB에 저장~~  
>> ~~python manage.py migrate (+ App 이름)~~  
>>                          ~~```~~
